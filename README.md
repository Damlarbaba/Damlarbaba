- About Me

Damilare Babatunde is my name. I am a Building Technology graduate of The Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State. After enrolling in a course on data analysis and visualisation, my interest in data skyrocketed. As a proponent of peace of mind, I soon see how much potential there is in analysing, visualising, and interpreting data to produce insightful decisions and take well-informed actions that ensure stakeholders in the organisation have peace of mind.

With a background in the construction industry and a strong aptitude for learning, listening, critical thinking, and problem-solving—I enjoy coming up with solutions to challenging tasks—I am confident that my journey in the data world will be fruitful and a source of inspiration for my potential clients.
I'm available for both short-term tasks and longer-term, part-time commitments.
